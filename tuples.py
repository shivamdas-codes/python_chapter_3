# eg: 1
tup = (3,4,5,6,8) #tuple values
print(type(tup))  #type of tuple
print(tup[0])
print(tup[1])
print(tup)
# tup[2] = 10    this represents assign or replace a new value with the old value, which is not valid in the tuples and immideatly it returns error.


# eg: 2
tup1 = () #an empty tuple
print(type(tup1))
print(tup1)
# this is absolutly valid in the tuples, we can assign the empty value in the tuples


# eg: 3
